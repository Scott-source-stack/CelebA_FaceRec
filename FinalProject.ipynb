    "## Part 1:  Preparing the CelebA Dataset for a Known vs. Unknown Face Recognition Task\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part of the project, we will prepare the CelebA face dataset for a classification task in which the model must decide if the face belongs to a known or unknown individual. Given that the dataset contains over 200 thousand faces with each face showing up anywhere from only a few times to 30+, we will be selecting identities of \"known\" individuals based on a list that only contains the IDs of individuals with 30 or more appearances.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We read from the `identity_CelebA.txt` file to map each image filename to an identity ID. This gives us the necessary labels for determining which images correspond to which person.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. We create a subset of identities where each chosen ID appears at least 30 times within the dataset. The rest of the identities are excluded from the known-class pool.\n",
